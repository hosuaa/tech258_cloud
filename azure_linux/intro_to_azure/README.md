# Azure

## Azure Basics
Azure is a cloud  platform provided by Microsoft that offers a variety of services, including computing power, storage, and networking, among others, over the internet. Users can leverage Azure to build, deploy, and manage applications and services through Microsoft's global network of data centers.
## Azure regions
Azure Regions: Azure regions are geographical areas where Azure resources are located. Each region is made up of one or more data centers that are in close proximity to each other. This setup ensures redundancy and fault tolerance. Azure regions are spread across the globe to provide low-latency access to services for users in different parts of the world.

Availability Zones: Availability Zones are physically separate data centers within an Azure region. They are designed to provide high availability and fault tolerance by ensuring that if one zone fails, resources can automatically failover to another zone within the same region. This setup enhances resilience and helps minimize downtime.
