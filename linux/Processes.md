## List processes

Linux has multiple ways of listing the processes currently running:

- `ps` - Prints the currently running user processes
  - `-p <PID>` prints the process with the given process id (PID).
    - `ps -p $$` prints the bash process
    - `ps aux` displays a lot more information and system proceses as a snapshot
  
- `top` - Prints the system processes. Similar to ps aux but live. As a result, we can sort by shift+key (e.g. shift+M to sort by memory). Sorts by CPU usage by default.
  
- `jobs` - Prints currently running jobs

## Kill processes 

We can kill processes from the terminal.

When a process locks up our terminal, there are 3 ways we can free our terminal from the process:
1. `q`. (Safest)
2. `Ctrl-C`
3. `Ctrl-Z` (Unsafe)

We can also kill specific processes running on our machine

- `kill -x pid` - Kills process with pid with kill signal x (default: 15)
  - 15 gracefully tries to kill the process by stopping child processes first then the parent ('Terminated')
  - 9 is brute force kill, harshest possible, could make zombie processes if you kill a parent process ('Killed')

## Parent, Child and zombie processes

A process is a parent process if it spawns another process that is dependant on it. That subprocess is called a child process.

If the parent process is terminated, the child process may not automatically terminate, and so will run until manually terminated. This is called a zombie process.
